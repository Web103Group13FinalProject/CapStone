## About

### Description and Purpose

PostGrid is a social media platform that allows users to post text and/or image content in the form of a post to a grid. Users can create an account, log in, and post content to their grid. Users can also view other users' grids and like their posts. Users can also comment on other users' posts.

### Inspiration

The inspiration for this was to have posting features like Twitter and Instagram, but have a display feature sort of like Pintrest where all posts would be displyed in some grid pattern.
