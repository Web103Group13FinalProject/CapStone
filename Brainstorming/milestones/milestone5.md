## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to figure out all the basic backend logic and implement it to the frotend.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

There were a few challenges getting the idea situated with the time limit we had and the time we could allocate to work on the project outside of school and other obligations.

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?

Getting the backend to sync well with the frotend, especially for the path operations was satisfying to see happen.

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?

We have learned a lot regarding the backend and figured out many different practices that will be helpful when working on full stack applications in the future.

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?

In the short run we plan on adding more to this project and making it look nicer since we weren't able to due to time contraints. In the long run we plan on learning more about backend development and implement other features such as user authentication and more.
